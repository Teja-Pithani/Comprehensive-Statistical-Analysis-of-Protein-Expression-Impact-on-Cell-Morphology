# 🧬 # Comprehensive-Statistical-Analysis-of-Protein-Expression-Impact-on-Cell-Morphology 📊

## 🌐 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of protein expression levels (P1 and P2) under various experimental conditions. The analysis leverages a dataset of expression levels and employs statistical and visualization techniques to derive meaningful insights.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes expression levels of proteins P1 and P2, cell size, major and minor axis lengths, experimental conditions, and replication counts. The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

## 🛠️ Features

The analysis extracts and examines various features from the dataset, including:
- Protein expression levels (P1 and P2)
- Cell size and dimensions
- Experimental conditions
- Replication counts

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd protiens
   ```
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn altair scipy scikit-learn statsmodels
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (`protiens.ipynb`) in an environment that supports execution (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab):
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook protiens.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the notebook cells to import libraries, load the dataset, and perform the analysis.
5. Review the visualizations and statistical test results to understand the impact of different experimental conditions on protein expression levels.

## 📁 Files
